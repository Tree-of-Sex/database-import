# database-import

everything for integrating other databases into the Tree of Sex database.

## What is the idea

We want to integrate other databases in a smart way - in a way, that we could do it again. In a way, that would be compatible with all the ways others store data.

The idea is to create config-files, that would map other databases onto Tree of Sex database terminology (defined by a dictionary at the moment, and by the ToS Ontology in not-so-distant future).

## YAML formating proposal

I would like to propose a YAML that will have formating as follows:

```
file:
  format: csv
  header: true
  comment: "#"
  name: TOS_data_2024-11-18_invertebrates.csv
  submitter: "Tree of Sex 1" # could be also ORCID if the imported "database" will be a personal sheet.
  default reference header: "citation" # ignore if an attribute has a specific refernce values

attributes:
  column_import: #Â for each imported column, there will be one of these blocks
    column_name: "Imported column name"
    column_reference: "Name of a column with references"
    destination:
      key: "name of the destination column"
      separator: # allows for multiple records per row, separated by one of the listed symbols
        - ","
        - "-"
      import_values: # listed values that will be imported together with translation to what they should be imported as
        - "source value": "destination value"
        - "Important Feat": "important feature" # or maybe magic "all" / "ints" / other types?
      ignore:
        - "Uninportant value" # specific values to ignore whem processing, overrides all
        - "Any other value not worth recording"
    destination:
      key: "The other key that gets information from this"
      import_values:
        - "Important Feat 2": "important feature in a different destination"
```

The full example can be found here: [TOS_data_2024-11-18_invertebrates2ToS1.1.0.yaml](https://github.com/Tree-of-Sex/database-import/blob/main/TOS_data_2024-11-18_invertebrates2ToS1.1.0.yaml), and the database file is [here](https://www.treeofsex.org/resources/data.invert.csv). I tried to make sure it covers every possible situation.

What people thing? WOuld this work?
